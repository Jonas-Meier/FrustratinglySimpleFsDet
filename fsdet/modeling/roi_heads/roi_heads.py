        # - 'box_features'-output from box_head is class-agnostic (ans same-sized for each head!), we can't do anything
        #    there!
        # - we use those features to obtain class-dependent activations (correct amount of target size is ensured by
        #    each 'predictor head'!
        # - for softmax calculation, we have to compare those activations against targets, which we obtain from
        #    the variable 'proposals', which contains objectness score (from RPN) and gt-class (and gt-boxes)
        # - those gt-data from the variable 'proposals' uses all available classes (and thus indices from
        #    0 to num_classes), we then need to transform those indices to appropriate indices for each head (and need
        #    to remember which number we mapped to which number at which head because each single head expects numbers
        #    or indices starting by 0, so our mapping destroys the unique numbers!
        # - we now have multiple possibilities what to do with our proposals: first of all, we decide to merge classes
        #    after softmax and to not merge the activations before the softmax. This would allow to skip the
        #    index-mapping but would also cause another problem: since each head produces background logits ans the
        #    final head, applying softmax on activations of all classes together just expects a single background class,
        #    so which of the background activations to choose and which to discard? This is a non-trivial problem and
        #    because of that, we choose to first apply softmax to each head and then merging the resulting class
        #    probabilities. We now assume wlog (without loss of generality) that we have batch-size 16 and using
        #    512 rois per batch yielding 8192 rois per batch (after roi pooling)
        #    - we could now take the Proposals and split them, depending on the target classes. In addition to this
        #      technique, we would probably want to use the background class activations for each head. If we think this
        #      idea a while further, we note that splitting of proposals into different heads does not make sense.
        #      We first note that each head i itself produces [8192, num_classes[i] + 1] classification logits because
        #      each head obtains 8192 rois as input (because the classification head splits after roi pooling, therefore
        #      each head encounters the same amount of input). For that matter, we either have to remove objects
        #      belonging to non-target classes at both sides, at feature side (class and box logits from the predictor)
        #      and at proposal-side (proposals from the RPN where GT-class is known), while keeping background class
        #      logits at EACH head.
        #    - another, and possibly more sophisticated, yet more simple, approach would be to use all proposals for
        #      each head with a little need in modification: at each head, change the target-class (gt-class) of the
        #      proposals for non-target classes of this head (not counting background class!) to 0. This means,
        #      non-target classes equal the background class.
        #      (Note: at Detectron2, the Background class is not the class with first index (0), but the class with
        #      last index (|num_classes|)!)
        #      Note: For training, we don't have to transform the indices back to the original indices because we're
        #      just interested in the loss which is automatically calculated correctly since the produced logits are
        #      yet in the correct shape and the adjusted class indices are automatically transferred into one-hot
        #      vectors for the classification loss (e.g. Cross Entropy). Therefore, we do not need back-transformation
        #      because we're done after calculating the loss.
        # - Inference: In contrast to training, we (of course) have not gt-annotations, therefore we cannot prepare or
        #   adjust the class of proposals. We don't even have to because we don't want to calculate losses. In contrast
        #   to the training however, we now need postprocessing of predicted classes after having calculated softmax
        #   probabilities because we need to know which class belongs to the highest probability for each proposal.
        #   In contrast to single-heads, we now have #heads predictions for each proposal because we input ALL
        #   proposals to each head. This could be problematic if we think of a case where for a single proposal one
        #   head produces a medium high confidence for an actual class (not background) and another head outputs high
        #   background confidence for that proposal (because it learned the target classes from different head as
        #   background class for itself). Probably this problem isn't an actual issue because the "Fast-RCNN"-Head
        #   won't output bbox predictions for Background class which would leave us with just a single valid prediction
        #   for that proposal (with medium confidence).
